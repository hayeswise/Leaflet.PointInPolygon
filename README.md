Leaflet.PointInPolygon is a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin/extension that provides point-in-polygon functions 
based on Dan Sunday's C++ winding number implementation. Functions `contains()`, `getWindingNumber()`, and `isLeft()` extend
Leaflet classes `L.Polygon`, `L.Polyline`, and `L.LatLng`.

The winding number method has an advantage to the crossing number method since 
"the winding number accurately determines if a point is inside a nonsimple closed polygon" 
(See [Inclusion of a Point in Polygon](http://geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html) by Dan Sunday).

Unlike the C++ implementation,
points on the lines and vertices are considered as being included in the polygon.  As such, the `getWindingNumber()` function will
work for a polyline. The inclusiveness of points on the the polygon lines (and polylines) has a natural interpretation for 
locations on maps.  A future version of Leaflet.PointInPolygon will support the ability to be inclusive or exclusive.

# Requirements
* Leaflet:  This has been tested on a variant of Leaflet version 0.7.7, version Leaflet 1.0.3 (from GitHub), and [Leaflet.Geodesic](https://github.com/Fragger/Leaflet.Geodesic) dated April 26, 2013.

# Demos
Demo on JSFiddle: [Leaflet.PointInPolygon Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/hayeswise/bh2wuve8/embedded/result,html,js,css).  And if you want to fork a copy of the fiddle, [click here](https://jsfiddle.net/hayeswise/bh2wuve8/). Click on the map or the markers and a pop-up will show indicating if the point you clicked on, or the marker, is in the polygon.

Leaflet.PointInPolygon is plugin was Originally developed for the [Ingress Intel Total Conversion](https://iitc.me/)(IITC). 
If you have a [Ingress](https://ingress.com/) account, install the Ingress Intel Total Conversion desktop and 
the install the [Portals-in-Polygons](https://github.com/hayeswise/iitc-portalsinpolygons) plugin.

# Instructions for Including the Plugin

## Web Page Inclusion
Use the script tag and pull from the CDN.

RawGit Production CDN:
```
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/hayeswise/Leaflet.PointInPolygon/v1.0.0/wise-leaflet-pip.js"></script>
```
RawGit Development CDN
```
<script src="https://rawgit.com/hayeswise/Leaflet.PointInPolygon/master/wise-leaflet-pip.js"></script>
```
## Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey

If you are using Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey scripts, as done with IITC plugins, use one of the following require metadata block keys and values:

* RawGit Production CDN:<br>
  @require        https://cdn.rawgit.com/hayeswise/Leaflet.PointInPolygon/v1.0.0/wise-leaflet-pip.js

* RawGit Development CDN:<br>
  @require        https://rawgit.com/hayeswise/Leaflet.PointInPolygon/master/wise-leaflet-pip.js

# API
See [API](https://github.com/hayeswise/Leaflet.PointInPolygon/blob/master/wise-leaflet-pip.md).

# Example

```
var polygon = L.polygon([
  [51.51, -0.08],
  [51.503, -0.06],
  [51.51, -0.047]
]).addTo(mymap);
var m1 = L.marker([51.515, -0.07]); // Outside and north of polygon
var m2 = L.marker([51.506, -0.06]); // In polygon, not on border
var m3 = L.marker([51.505, -0.074]); // Inside polygon boundary box but outside of polygon. 
var m4 = L.marker([51.51, -0.067]); // On polygon border.

console.log(polygon.contains(m1.getLatLng()));
// ==> false
console.log(polygon.contains(m2.getLatLng()));
// ==> true
console.log(polygon.contains(m3.getLatLng()));
// ==> false
console.log(polygon.contains(m4.getLatLng()));
// ==> true
```

# CDN
CDN services provided by [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/).  This is useful for referencing the code distribution in [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).  Just note that the CDN updates lag behind the GitHub updates.  Production updates are behind Development updates. The Production CDN has no limits or throttling (but since this is a free service, there's no uptime or support guarantees).
